# Citi Bike Analysis
## Project Overview
In the following project, we analyzed Citi Bike data to determine the viability of expanding the service to different metropolitan areas. Citi Bike is a bike-sharing system in New York City with over a thousand docking stations where subscribers and casual users can access the vast network of available bikes through the Citi Bike app to get around the bustling metropolis. It provides users a convenient and reliable way to explore the city or even improve their commutes. The service also has many benefits to the city, such as reducing congestion and emissions. Citibike is a revolutionary service that has the potential to improve the transportation networks of cities across the nation. We will be using Tableau to understand how Citi Bike is used to optimize the service. Our analysis will provide us with insights to extrapolate to other metropolitan areas in the United States.
